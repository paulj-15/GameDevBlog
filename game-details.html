                <h2>First Entry</h2>
                <p class="entry-date">March 20, 2025</p>
                <p>Created the first basic prototype for player movement and interactions with basic heatseeker ball mechanics.</p>
                <p>Upon hitting the 'F' key the ball bounces back to player 2.</p>
                <p>Note: The ball bounces back either way, but if the 'F' key is hit at the right moment, the player does not get launched upwards.</p>

                <h2>Second Entry</h2>
                <p class="entry-date">March 30, 2025</p>
                <p>Tried out the first ability for the player.</p>
                <p>What you see here is the proximity-based teleportation. Much like the agent Omen and his Shrouded Step ability in Valorant.</p>
                <p>Note: The teleportation ability as of now, does not have a marker, but it would hopefully be fixed up in the next iteration and entry.</p>
