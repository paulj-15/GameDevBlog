                <h2>First Entry</h2>
                <p class="entry-date">March 20, 2025</p>
                <p>The first basic prototype for player movement and interactions with basic heatseeker ball mechanics.</p>
                <p>I made the heatseeker mechanics target the player, as it was intended in the primary plan.</p>
                <p>However, as you can see it led to issues based on the character collision and ball speed.</p>
                <p>Note: The ball bounces back either way, but if the 'F' key is hit at the right moment, the player does not get launched upwards. This would be fixed in a later update.</p>

                <h2>Second Entry</h2>
                <p class="entry-date">March 30, 2025</p>
                <p>Tried out the first ability for the player.</p>
                <p>What you see here is the proximity-based teleportation.</p>
                <p>Much like the agent Omen and his Shrouded Step ability in Valorant.</p>
                <p>Note: The teleportation ability as of now, does not have a marker, but it would hopefully be fixed up in the next iteration and entry.</p>

                <h2>Third Entry</h2>
                <p class="entry-date">April 5, 2025</p>
                <p>Went further with the ability portion of the character.</p>
                <p>This time I took a Shield ability, where the player can block upcoming ball barrages.</p>
                <p>Upon stopping the ball, the player can hit it back with the help of the 'F' key</p>
                <p>We also made the ball target onto the goal posts behind the player</p>
                <p>As it would be much more easier to understand and play around with.</p>

                <h2>Fourth Entry</h2>
                <p class="entry-date">April 17, 2025</p>
                <p>Added a Charge Attack Mechanic onto the player,</p>
                <p>The player can charge his attack using the "C" key and release the charge using the "E" key.</p>
                <p>The charge decays over time. So spam that button!!!</p>
                <p>I've also added a High Jump/Hover ability for player traversal</p>
                <p>We're also planning a grappling ability for later iterations.</p>

                <h2>Fifth Entry</h2>
                <p class="entry-date">April 26, 2025</p>
                <p>Integration takes time but as our designers ran into some trouble, we had to wait until now to start integration.</p>
                <p>The model given to me by our designers were of a robot, so we used that and still have the primitive shapes for shield and the ball, as it's only a prototype.</p>
                <p>Wohooo!! I also figured out a way to create a marker for the teleportation ability. It looks cool btw.</p>
                <p>Had an opportunity to play with the animation system as well.</p>
                <p>During this final week, I will also be trying to support the design team with VFX and SFX for the game.</p>

                <p class="entry-date">May 3, 2025</p>
                <p>Yes, yes. Finally the most exciting part, THE AESTHETICS!!!!</p>
                <p>It was fun and honestly kinda challenging to find suitable VFX and SFX for teleportation but nonetheless, I managed to.</p>
                <p>Looks kinda cool now huh? Well, it wasn't like this primarly, I spent a while tweaking the VFX to look like what it is now, </p>
                <p>Had an opportunity to play with the animation system as well. I also found a well-paired SFX to be triggered at the beginning of the ability.</p>
                <p>Moreover, I spent a lot of time with the UI system, as you can see there is a scoring system and a respawn system after a countdown delay.</p>
                <p>Don't know if you've noticed, but there's also slow motion.... Just so that you don't miss it ü§≠ü§≠.</p>
