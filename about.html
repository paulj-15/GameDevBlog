                <h2>Hi, I'm Paul John Shaji ðŸ‘‹</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey there! Iâ€™m a passionate game developer with a deep love for crafting immersive and engaging experiences. Currently pursuing my MSc in Game Development (Programming), I specialize in Gameplay and narrative mechanics, and innovative game design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve spent over 3 years prototyping and developing games, interacting with players, negotiating creative ideas, and refining strategies to build better experiences. Whether it's designing self-learning NPCs in Unreal Engine 5 or creating fast-paced multiplayer games in Unity 6, Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of interactive storytelling and gameplay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dream is to launch my own game development studio alongside my close friend, where we can bring our ideas to life and publish games that leave a lasting impact. This blog is a space where I share my development journey, insights, challenges, and technical breakdownsâ€”whether itâ€™s about AI, networking, or game mechanics. If you're into game dev, AI, or just love seeing games come to life, youâ€™re in the right place!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Come join my journey and Let's build amazing games together!
